<p>From the graph above, we can conclude that the number of new case increase very quick after 2020 Sep. Then, the slope became stable after 2020 Oct. However, the vaccinations program was launch after 2020 Dec, and the daily case does not show any decrease trend after the vaccinations program. Then, there is anther peak at 2021 May. Therefore, the vaccinations program may not have effect on the covid-19</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong></p>
<p>We may consider other factor. The contraction between people or social distance may influence the epidemic</p>

<p>The graph shows Apple Maps usage for driving directions. We can find that large number of people drive outside at around 2020 Aug. Then, it has large daily new cases in the following days (around 2020 Oct). This is reasonable, because the covid-19 virus spreaded by the air. If more people get togather, the people will have more probability to infect the covid-19 virus. Then, the infected people usually are test as the positive after a few days.</p>
<p>During the 2020 Sep to 2020 Dec, there are less people driving out, the number of daily new case increase slowly after 2020 Nov. since the less people, the spreading become slow.</p>

</div>
<p>It is not far from our guess, when the lock down increase, the daily new will decrease. when the lock down decrease, the total confirmed cases will increase very quick, for example, the confirmed cases incrase very quick from 2020 Jun to 2020 Nov. However, it does not have large effect after 2020 Dec. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I just determine the two question. Firstly, I talk about How the vaccinations program influence the covid-19 spreading. Then, I use data to show the outside activity and lockdown influence the covid-19 spreading</p>
